# Predict Customer Personality to Boost Marketing Campaign by Using Machine Learning

This project originally came from an assignment after a data science bootcamp program that I attended. Which is why you can see there are several folders of **`tasks`** that contain instructions about business questions that must be answered based on data and my presentation of them. I then developed the project further by adding new knowledge that I learned from work experience, online courses, and other sources.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:

This project aims to enhance marketing campaign effectiveness through customer segmentation and personality analysis. By analyzing customer data including demographics, spending behavior, and engagement metrics, the company seek to develop targeted marketing strategies that improve campaign performance and customer satisfaction. Our task here as a data analyst work with cross-functional teams of marketing and sales department, where the Marketing team will use your segmentation to optimize campaigns and customer communication, while the Sales team can leverage your insights to personalize their approach to different customer types.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Definitions:

1. Customer Segmentation: How can we group customers into meaningful segments based on their characteristics and behaviors?

2. Campaign Optimization: How can we tailor marketing campaigns to different customer segments to improve response rates and conversion?

## ðŸ“Œ Assumptions & Scope Limitations (based on extracted/provided dataset):

1. The data provided is accurate and representative of the customer base.

2. Past behavior (purchases, website visits, campaign responses) is indicative of future behavior.

3. Demographic factors (age, education, marital status) influence purchasing decisions.

4. Customer complaints within the last 2 years significantly impact their relationship with the company.

5. The recency of a customer's last purchase is related to their likelihood of future purchases.

6. Customers who engage more frequently (website visits, purchases) are more valuable to the company.

## ðŸ“ŒI also created a streamlit app from this project that can be tried with these commands:

```python
cd scripts
streamlit run app.py
```

Just follow the instructions inside the streamlit app and try it out.
